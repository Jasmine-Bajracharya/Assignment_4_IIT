		<h1>Holidays</h1>
        <p>We can only afford to take a trip if the cost is no more than 
        $7,500.</p>
        <p>And if the exchange rate falls below 75<font face="Times New Roman">ï¿½ 
        it will have to be in Australia.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function trip OK()</font> works out whether we can or can't go on a holiday. You are to test this function.</p>
<p>Use integer numbers for trip cost and exchange rate.<br>
        Use true | false for overseas and trip OK.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>
        1: There may be no errors to find.<br>
        2: Description and coverage are important.<br>
        3: Avoid numbers in your description<br>
        4: Do not write more than 10 tests.</p>

        <p>There is an example line in the table. You will need to remove / edit this one.</p>
